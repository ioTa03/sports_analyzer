# Player Analysis Using AI and Computer Vision

## Introduction
We are building an innovative project aimed at detecting and tracking players, referees, and footballs in videos using YOLO, one of the most advanced AI object detection models available. As part of our efforts, we will fine-tune and train the YOLO model to enhance its accuracy and adaptability to the specific requirements of football matches.

We are also clustering players into teams based on the colors of their t-shirts using KMeans for pixel segmentation. With this clustering, we aim to analyze and calculate a team's ball possession percentage during the match. Additionally, we are working on leveraging optical flow to measure camera movement between frames, ensuring precise calculation of player movements.

By implementing perspective transformation, we will add depth and perspective to the scenes, enabling us to represent a playerâ€™s movement in meters rather than pixels. With these components, we will calculate each player's speed and the distance they cover during a match.

Finally, we aim to achieve a robust and insightful player analysis system, combining these methods to provide real-world insights into player performance and team dynamics.

## Current Progress
We are actively working on:
1. Training a custom YOLOv5 model to adapt to football-specific scenarios.
2. Implementing KMeans for precise player-team assignment.
3. Integrating optical flow to compensate for camera movements.
4. Developing perspective transformation pipelines for accurate depth measurement.
5. Designing modules to calculate and visualize speed, distance, and other metrics.
